    Hi there! I graduated from the University of Puerto Rico - Aguadilla campus with a bachelor degree in Biological sciences. I'm a fast learner, animal lover, and a traveler with a passion for technology. 

    Upon moving to New York City, I developed quite an interest in programming which manifested by self-teaching different languages in my spare time (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python). I recently graduate from General Assembly Software Engineer Bootcamp, and after that I started an internship with Minti as a Software engineer Intern; which taught me how the development area works, how to think outside the box and how to perform at a high level in high pressure environment.
